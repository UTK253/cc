Follow these steps:\n\n5 THINGS YOU CAN SEE\nLook around and name 5 things you can see. Focus on small details.\n\n4 THINGS YOU CAN TOUCH\nNotice the texture of your clothes, the smoothness of your desk, the temperature of the air.\n\n3 THINGS YOU CAN HEAR\nListen carefully - maybe a clock ticking, traffic outside, or your own breathing.\n\n2 THINGS YOU CAN SMELL\nThis might require you to move around. Notice any scents in your environment.\n\n1 THING YOU CAN TASTE\nWhat does your mouth taste like right now? Notice the sensation.\n\nRepeat this exercise whenever you feel overwhelmed. It brings your mind back to the present moment and interrupts the anxiety spiral.",

REFRAME NEGATIVE THOUGHTS\nWhen something goes wrong, ask: 'What can I learn from this?' instead of 'Why does this always happen to me?'\n\n2. BUILD A SUPPORT NETWORK\nStrong relationships provide emotional support during tough times. Invest in authentic connections.\n\n3. PRACTICE SELF-COMPASSION\nTreat yourself with the same kindness you'd show a good friend facing difficulties.\n\n4. SET REALISTIC GOALS\nBreak big challenges into smaller, achievable steps. Celebrate small wins.\n\n5. MAINTAIN PERSPECTIVE\nAsk yourself: 'Will this matter in 5 years?' Most stressors are temporary.\n\n6. TAKE CARE OF YOUR BODY\nPhysical health directly impacts mental resilience. Prioritize sleep, exercise, and nutrition.\n\nResilience isn't about avoiding stress—it's about learning to navigate it effectively.",
